# Tensorflow RNN to Events Prediction
Tensorflow Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to analyse Time Series in GDELT News dataset to predict future events.

This Google Datalab notebook shows how to create a simple RNN model to perform analysis of GDELT news events dataset.

# Installation
To run this notebook, please follow these steps:
* Create Datalab project in Google Cloud Platform: https://cloud.google.com/datalab/docs/quickstart (do not worry about payment options, default quota is enought to run this demo notebook for free).
* Upload notebook [GDC Meetup Paris GDELT-skflow-RNN](https://github.com/marsbroshok/tensorflow-rnn-events-prediction/blob/master/GDC%20Meetup%20Paris%20GDELT-skflow-RNN.ipynb) to your Datalab envirement.
* Enjoy!
